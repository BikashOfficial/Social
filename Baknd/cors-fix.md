# Cross-Domain Authentication Fixes

This document provides an overview of the fixes implemented to resolve CORS and authentication issues between the frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) deployments.

## Problem Overview

The application was experiencing several issues:
1. Repeated login verification prompts
2. CORS errors when making API requests from the frontend to the backend
3. Authentication cookies not working properly across domains
4. Socket.io connection failures

## Implemented Fixes

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

1. **Enhanced CORS Configuration:**
   - Implemented dynamic origin checking
   - Added proper headers for preflight requests
   - Expanded allowed methods and headers

2. **Improved Cookie Settings:**
   - Added `secure: true` for production environments
   - Set `sameSite: 'none'` to allow cross-domain cookies
   - Consistent cookie configuration across login, register, and logout endpoints

3. **Robust Authentication Middleware:**
   - Token retrieval from multiple sources (cookies, headers, query params)
   - Better error handling for token verification
   - Automatic reestablishment of cookies from other auth sources

4. **Socket.io CORS Enhancement:**
   - Expanded CORS configuration for socket.io server
   - Added authentication token to socket connections
   - Improved reconnection handling

### Frontend (React)

1. **API Service Improvements:**
   - Enhanced retry mechanism for authentication failures
   - Consistent inclusion of credentials in all requests
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **Authentication State Management:**
   - Used sessionStorage for verification caching (30-minute window)
   - Implemented verification state tracking
   - More robust token handling in UserContext

3. **Socket Connection Enhancements:**
   - Added token-based authentication to socket
   - Improved reconnection logic
   - Better error handling and state management

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend (Render)

1. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   FRONTEND_URL=https://social-bice-xi.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Redeployment Steps:**
   - Commit all changes to your repository
   - Log in to Render dashboard
   - Navigate to your backend service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

### Frontend (Vercel)

1. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   VITE_BASE_URL=https://social-app-ybwk.onrender.com
   ```

2. **Redeployment Steps:**
   - Commit all changes to your repository
   - Vercel should automatically deploy the latest changes
   - Or manually trigger a deployment from the Vercel dashboard

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fixes by:

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Log in to the application
   - Refresh the page multiple times - you should stay logged in
   - Navigate between different routes - authentication should persist

2. **API Requests:**
   - Check browser console for CORS errors (there should be none)
   - Verify successful API calls to various endpoints

3. **Socket.io Connection:**
   - Check browser console for socket connection status
   - Verify real-time features like chat are working

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Check authentication-related logs

2. **Server Logs:**
   - Examine backend logs on Render for authentication issues
   - Look for socket connection errors

3. **Clear Browser Storage:**
   - Try clearing cookies and local storage
   - Test in an incognito/private window

4. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Double-check that environment variables are set correctly on both platforms
